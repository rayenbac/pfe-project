Already enabled! The chatbot will use this automatically.

#### **Option B: Groq (Fastest & Best)**
1. Go to [https://console.groq.com](https://console.groq.com)
2. Create a free account (takes 30 seconds)
3. Copy your API key
4. Edit `src/app/core/config/ai-config.ts`:
```typescript
groq: {
  provider: 'groq',
  apiKey: 'paste_your_key_here', // Your actual API key
  model: 'llama3-8b-8192',
  endpoint: 'https://api.groq.com/openai/v1/chat/completions',
  isEnabled: true, // Change to true
  maxTokens: 200,
  temperature: 0.7
}
```

#### **Option C: Self-Hosted (Most Private)**
Install Ollama locally for completely free AI:

# Download from https://ollama.ai
# Then run:

  // ... existing config
