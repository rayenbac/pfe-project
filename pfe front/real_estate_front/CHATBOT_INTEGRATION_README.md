## 🤖 AI Model Integration

### Current Implementation
- **Rule-based system** with keyword matching and intent detection
- **Extensible architecture** ready for AI model integration

#### Integration Example (Hugging Face)
```typescript
// Already included in service, just need API key
private async getAIResponse(message: string): Promise<string> {
  const response = await fetch('https://api-inference.huggingface.co/models/microsoft/DialoGPT-medium', {
    method: 'POST',
    headers: {
      'Authorization': 'Bearer hf_xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx' // Your API key
    },
    body: JSON.stringify({
      inputs: this.buildAIContext(message)
    })
  });
  // Process response...
}
```

if (this.matchesPatterns(msg, ['new intent keywords'])) {
  return { type: 'new_intent', data: { param: 'value' } };
}

// Add handler method
private async handleNewIntent(data: any): Promise<ChatMessage> {
  // Your custom logic here
  return {
    id: this.generateMessageId(),
    content: "Custom response",
    sender: 'bot',
    timestamp: new Date(),
    type: 'action',
    actions: [/* custom actions */]
  };
}
```

### Styling Customization
```css
/* Override chatbot colors in chatbot.component.css */
.chat-button {
  background: your-custom-gradient;
}

.chat-header {
  background: your-custom-header-color;
}
```

## 🔗 API Integration

### Backend Extension (Optional)
To add backend AI processing, create an endpoint:

```typescript
// In your backend
@Controller('/api/chatbot')
export class ChatbotController {
  @Post('/process')
  async processMessage(@Body() data: { message: string, context: any }) {
    // Process with AI model
    // Return structured response
  }
}
```

### Frontend Integration
```typescript
// In chatbot.service.ts
private async processWithBackend(message: string, context: any): Promise<ChatMessage> {
  const response = await this.http.post(`${this.apiUrl}/process`, {
    message,
    context
  }).toPromise();
  
  return this.formatBackendResponse(response);
}
```
