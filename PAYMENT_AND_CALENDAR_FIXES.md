# Payment and Calendar Issues - Resolution Summary

## Issues Identified and Fixed

### Issue 1: Inconsistent Amount During Payment Flow

**Problem**: The amount calculated in the Reservation component was different from the amount sent to Stripe/Konnect payment processors.

**Root Cause**: 
- Currency conversion was being applied inconsistently
- The converted amount was overwriting the original amount
- No clear tracking of original vs converted amounts

**Solution Implemented**:

1. **Enhanced Metadata Tracking** (`reservation.component.ts`):
   - Added `originalAmount` and `totalAmountOriginal` to metadata
   - Added explicit currency tracking
   - Preserved the exact calculated amount from reservation

2. **Improved Amount Handling** (`checkout.component.ts`):
   - Modified `setDisplayAmount()` to clearly separate original from converted amounts
   - Added comprehensive logging for amount calculations
   - Store both original and converted amounts in session storage
   - Use original amount for booking creation, converted amount for payment processing

3. **Session Storage Enhancement**:
   - Store `originalAmount`, `convertedAmount`, `originalCurrency`, and `paymentCurrency`
   - Ensure consistency across payment redirect flows

### Issue 2: Calendar Not Updating After Reservation

**Problem**: After completing a successful reservation, the property's calendar did not show the new booking as unavailable.

**Root Cause**:
- Insufficient calendar refresh mechanisms
- Missing event listeners for booking creation
- Backend booking creation may have been failing silently

**Solution Implemented**:

1. **Enhanced Calendar Refresh** (`availability-calendar.component.ts`):
   - Added multiple refresh triggers: storage events, custom events, visibility changes
   - Added listener for `bookingCreated` custom events
   - Added check for `calendar_refresh_needed` storage key
   - Added automatic refresh when tab becomes visible

2. **Improved Booking Creation** (`success.component.ts`):
   - Enhanced `createRealBooking()` with better error handling
   - Added multiple notification mechanisms for calendar refresh
   - Fire custom `bookingCreated` event with booking details
   - Store property-specific refresh flags in localStorage

3. **Backend Improvements** (`booking.controller.ts`):
   - Enhanced availability endpoint with better logging
   - Improved booking creation with detailed console logging
   - Fixed date range calculations for proper availability checking
   - Better handling of past dates vs booked dates

4. **Reservation Component Updates** (`reservation.component.ts`):
   - Added booking creation event listener
   - Added currency consistency tracking
   - Enhanced metadata with all necessary fields

## Key Technical Improvements

### Amount Consistency
```typescript
// Before: Amount could change during conversion
this.displayAmount = +(baseAmount * this.exchangeRates['USD']).toFixed(2);

// After: Original amount preserved, conversion tracked separately
const reservationSession = {
  totalAmount: this.totalAmount, // Original amount
  displayAmount: amountUSD, // Converted amount
  metadata: {
    originalAmount: this.totalAmount,
    convertedAmount: amountUSD,
    originalCurrency: this.propertyCurrency,
    paymentCurrency: 'USD'
  }
};
```

### Calendar Refresh Mechanism
```typescript
// Multiple refresh triggers for robust calendar updates
localStorage.setItem('booking_created', Date.now().toString());
localStorage.setItem('calendar_refresh_needed', propertyId);
window.dispatchEvent(new CustomEvent('bookingCreated', {
  detail: { propertyId, booking, startDate, endDate }
}));
```

### Enhanced Error Handling
- Added comprehensive console logging throughout the payment flow
- Better error messages for debugging
- Preserved reservation data even when booking creation fails
- Added validation for property data integrity

## Testing Recommendations

1. **Amount Verification**:
   - Test with different property currencies (USD, TND)
   - Verify amounts remain consistent from reservation → checkout → payment → success
   - Check both Stripe and Konnect payment flows

2. **Calendar Updates**:
   - Create a reservation and immediately check calendar
   - Test calendar refresh in multiple browser tabs
   - Verify booked dates show as unavailable
   - Test with different date ranges and guest counts

3. **Cross-Browser Testing**:
   - Test session storage persistence across payment redirects
   - Verify localStorage events work across tabs
   - Check custom event handling in different browsers

## Monitoring Points

- Monitor console logs for booking creation status
- Check localStorage for refresh triggers
- Verify session storage data before/after payment redirects
- Validate that booked dates appear in calendar API responses

## Files Modified

### Frontend
- `reservation.component.ts` - Enhanced metadata and currency tracking
- `checkout.component.ts` - Improved amount handling and session storage
- `success.component.ts` - Better booking creation and calendar refresh
- `availability-calendar.component.ts` - Multiple refresh mechanisms

### Backend
- `booking.controller.ts` - Enhanced logging and availability calculations

The fixes ensure that:
1. **Amount consistency** is maintained throughout the entire payment flow
2. **Calendar updates** happen reliably after booking creation
3. **Error handling** provides clear feedback for debugging
4. **Cross-tab communication** keeps all views synchronized
