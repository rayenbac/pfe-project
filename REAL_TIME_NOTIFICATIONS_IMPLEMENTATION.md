# Real-time Notification System Implementation

## Overview
This document outlines the complete implementation of a real-time notification system for your Express TypeScript backend and Angular TypeScript frontend using Socket.IO.

## Backend Implementation

### 1. Enhanced Notification Types
- **File**: `src/Interfaces/notification/INotification.ts`
- **Added notification types**:
  - `booking_confirmed`, `new_booking`
  - `favorite_property_updated`
  - `property_reviewed`
  - `post_commented`
  - `admin_new_property`, `admin_property_updated`, `admin_report_received`

### 2. Real-time Notification Service
- **File**: `src/Services/realtime-notification.service.ts`
- **Features**:
  - Socket.IO integration for real-time notifications
  - Database persistence
  - Notification triggers for all specified events
  - Helper methods for finding related users

### 3. Enhanced Controllers
Updated the following controllers to trigger notifications:

#### Booking Controller (`src/Controllers/booking.controller.ts`)
- Triggers notifications when bookings are created
- Triggers notifications when bookings are confirmed

#### Property Controller (`src/Controllers/property.controller.ts`)
- Notifies admin when new properties are added
- Notifies admin when properties are updated
- Notifies users when favorite properties are updated

#### Payment Controller (`src/Controllers/payment.controller.ts`)
- Notifies users when payments are confirmed

#### Review Controller (`src/Controllers/review.controller.ts`)
- Notifies property owners when reviews are added

### 4. Enhanced Socket.IO Setup
- **File**: `src/server/socket.ts`
- **Features**:
  - Real-time chat messaging with notification integration
  - Notification-specific socket events
  - User presence management

### 5. Updated Routes
- **File**: `src/Routes/notification.routes.ts`
- **Added routes**:
  - `DELETE /user/all` - Delete all notifications for a user
  - Added authentication middleware to all routes

### 6. Dependency Injection
- **File**: `src/DI/iversify.config.ts`
- Registered `RealtimeNotificationService` in the DI container

## Frontend Implementation

### 1. Notification Models
- **File**: `src/app/models/notification.model.ts`
- **Features**:
  - Complete TypeScript interfaces
  - All notification types defined

### 2. Notification Service
- **File**: `src/app/services/notification.service.ts`
- **Features**:
  - Socket.IO client integration
  - Reactive streams using RxJS
  - HTTP API methods
  - Browser notification support
  - Real-time updates

### 3. Notification Dropdown Component
- **File**: `src/app/components/notification-dropdown/notification-dropdown.component.ts`
- **Features**:
  - Bell icon with unread count badge
  - Dropdown with latest 10 notifications
  - Mark as read/delete functionality
  - Real-time updates

### 4. Full Notifications Page
- **File**: `src/app/pages/notifications/notifications.component.ts`
- **Features**:
  - Complete notifications management interface
  - Filtering and pagination
  - Statistics dashboard
  - Bulk operations (mark all read, delete all)

## Notification Triggers Implemented

### 1. Booking Notifications ✅
- **New Booking**: When a user books a property → notify property owner
- **Booking Confirmed**: When booking status is confirmed → notify guest

### 2. Messaging Notifications ✅
- **New Message**: When users exchange messages → notify recipient
- Real-time chat integration

### 3. Favorite Property Updates ✅
- **Property Updated**: When a favorited property is updated → notify users who favorited it

### 4. Payment Notifications ✅
- **Payment Confirmed**: When payment status is confirmed → notify user

### 5. Review Notifications ✅
- **Property Reviewed**: When a review is left → notify property owner

### 6. Admin Notifications ✅
- **New Property**: When property is added → notify admins
- **Property Updated**: When property is updated → notify admins
- **Report Received**: When items are reported → notify admins

### 7. Post Comments (Ready for Implementation)
- Framework in place, requires comment functionality to be added to posts

## Key Features

### Real-time Capabilities
- Socket.IO integration on both backend and frontend
- Instant notification delivery without page refresh
- User presence tracking
- Real-time chat with notification integration

### Database Persistence
- All notifications stored in MongoDB
- Persistent across user sessions
- Support for read/unread status
- Bulk operations support

### User Experience
- Browser notifications (with permission)
- Dropdown interface for quick access
- Full-page notification management
- Priority-based styling
- Time-ago formatting

### Admin Features
- Separate notification types for admin activities
- Moderation notifications
- Property management alerts

## Usage Instructions

### Backend Setup
1. The notification service is automatically initialized with Socket.IO
2. Controllers will automatically trigger notifications based on user actions
3. No additional setup required - notifications work out of the box

### Frontend Integration
1. Add the notification dropdown component to your header/navbar:
   ```html
   <app-notification-dropdown></app-notification-dropdown>
   ```

2. Add routing for the full notifications page:
   ```typescript
   { path: 'notifications', component: NotificationsPageComponent }
   ```

3. The notification service automatically connects when users are authenticated

### Socket.IO Events
The system uses these real-time events:
- `new_notification` - New notification received
- `notification_read` - Notification marked as read
- `notification_deleted` - Notification deleted
- `all_notifications_deleted` - All notifications cleared

## Configuration

### Environment Variables
Make sure your environment is configured:
- Backend runs on `http://localhost:3001`
- Frontend API calls go to `http://localhost:3000/api`
- Socket.IO connection to `http://localhost:3001`

### Authentication
The system uses JWT tokens for authentication and ensures notifications are only sent to intended recipients.

## Security Features
- Authentication required for all notification operations
- Users can only see their own notifications
- Admin notifications are restricted to admin users
- Socket.IO rooms for user isolation

## Extensibility
The system is designed to be easily extensible:
- Add new notification types in the interfaces
- Create new trigger methods in the RealtimeNotificationService
- Add new controllers/events as needed
- Frontend components automatically handle new notification types

## Testing
To test the notification system:
1. Create a booking → Property owner should receive notification
2. Send a message → Recipient should receive notification
3. Update a property → Users who favorited it should receive notification
4. Confirm a payment → User should receive notification
5. Leave a review → Property owner should receive notification

All notifications should appear in real-time in both the dropdown and full notifications page.
